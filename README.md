# Registration Page with HTML, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and JavaScript Validation

## Project Overview

This project is a **registration page** where users can create an account by entering their details. The page is designed using **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, **Font Awesome** icons, and **JavaScript** for form validation. It provides a responsive, user-friendly interface and ensures that the input data meets the required criteria before submission.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Layout**: The page adapts to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using **Bootstrap**'s grid system.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Enhances the form with icons for a better user experience (e.g., a user icon for username, a lock icon for the password).
- **JavaScript Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs are correct before submitting the form. This includes:
  - **Required fields** (Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password).
  - **Email format validation**.
  - **Password strength** (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
  - **Password and Confirm Password match**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the page content.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling the form.
- **Font Awesome**: To add icons to form elements.
- **JavaScript**: For validating user input before form submission.

### JavaScript Validation Details:
- **Name**: Ensures the field is not empty.
- **Email**: Checks if the email follows a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).
- **Password**: Ensures the password is strong enough (e.g., at least 8 characters, includes a number or special character).
- **Confirm Password**: Checks if the "Confirm Password" matches the password field.

## Usage

Once you've cloned or downloaded the repository, open the `index.html` file in your browser. The registration form will allow users to input their data, and JavaScript will validate it when the form is submitted.

If any field is invalid, an error message will be displayed next to the relevant field. The form will not be submitted until all validations are passed.

## Customization

Feel free to:
- Modify the form fields or layout.
- Adjust the validation criteria in the `script.js` file (such as changing password strength rules).
- Add additional form fields or validation rules as needed.
